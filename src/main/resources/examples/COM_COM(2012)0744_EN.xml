                        insolvency proceedings. It determines which Member State has jurisdiction

                        law and provides for the recognition and enforcement of insolvency-related

                        should notably extend to proceedings which provide for the restructuring of

                    <p>The rules on jurisdiction for opening insolvency proceedings should be
                        clarified and the procedural framework for determining jurisdiction should
                        be improved. There should also be an explicit rule on jurisdiction for
                        actions which are deriving directly from insolvency proceedings or are
                        closely linked with them. </p>

                        requirement that secondary proceedings must be winding-up proceedings should
                        be abolished. Moreover, a court should be able to refuse the opening of
                        secondary proceedings if this is not necessary to protect the interests of
                        local creditors. The coordination between main and secondary proceedings

                        and courts involved in the different insolvency proceedings should be
                        obliged to cooperate and communicate with each other. In addition, any of
                        the liquidators involved should have the procedural tools to propose a
                        rescue plan for the group companies subject to insolvency proceedings and to
                        request, where necessary, a stay of the insolvency proceedings concerning a
                        company other than the one for which they were appointed. The definition of
                        the term ‘group of companies’ should be understood as being limited to the
                        context of insolvency and should not have any influence on the company
                        aspects regarding groups.</p>

                        level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should

                                                  concurrent proceedings pending are coordinated.
                                                  The main condition here is that the various
                                                  liquidators and the courts involved must cooperate
                                                  closely, in particular by exchanging a sufficient
                                                  amount of information. In order to ensure the
                                                  dominant role of the main proceedings, the
                                                  liquidator in such proceedings should be given
                                                  several possibilities for intervening in secondary

                                                  same time. In particular, the liquidator should be
                                                  able to propose a restructuring plan or
                                                  composition or apply for a suspension of the

                                                  insolvency proceedings. In their cooperation,
                                                  liquidators and courts should take into account
