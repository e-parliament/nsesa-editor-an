/**
 * Note: this package is imported from the gwt-selection project because it is not available in Maven,
 * and including jars in our repository, as well as extending the build to include this jar is far more
 * than I'm willing to do. So, until this jar shows up (mail was sent with the request on the 18th of July 2013),
 * we're going to simply include it here.
