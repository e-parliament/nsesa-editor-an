            Standard factory, which is used for ALL your DTO/Entity implementations.
            Judging from experience - you should not put entities in here, these should only be
                                      created manually, or through converters invoking special methods
                                      on your Entity. E.g. Order object might have Order.createOrderLine()
                                      method. And you can use on-entity-assembly event handler to invoke
                                      that.
